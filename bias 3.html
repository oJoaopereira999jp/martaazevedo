        « “classifications are powerful technologies. Embedded in working infrastructures they become relatively invisible without losing any of their power.” Classification is an act of power, be it labelling images in AI training sets, <span

We can easily forget that the classifications that are casually chosen to shape a technical system can play a dynamic role in shaping the social and material world. The tendency to focus on the issue of bias in artificial intelligence has drawn us away from assessing the core practices of classification in AI, along with their attendant politics. » </h3>

      « Classification systems require the prior construction or discovery of “invariant” features, on the basis of which they assign and reduce objects. The choice or discovery of these categories is motivated: in commercial online systems, they are ones that maximize clicks; in predictive <span
