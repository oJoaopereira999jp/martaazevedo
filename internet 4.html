        <h2>« One of the metaphors we used when designing such a <span
            class="popup-trigger-system"><mark>system</mark>  <div class="popup-system"><p class="texto-1">a set of connected things or devices that operate together.</p></div></span> was that of a musical instrument, such as a flute, which is owned by its <span
            class="popup-trigger-user"><mark>user</mark>  <div class="popup-user"><p class="texto-2">someone who uses another person or a product/machine in order to get some advantage for themselves.</p></div></span> and responds instantly and consistently to its owner’s wishes. Imagine the absurdity of a one-second delay between blowing a note and hearing it! »

« We are exploring the use of this system as a programming and problem-solving tool; as an interactive memory for the storage and manipulation of data; as a text editor; and as a medium for <span
class="popup-trigger-expression"><mark>expression</mark>  <div class="popup-expression"><p class="texto-3">the act of saying what you think or showing how you feel using words or actions.</p></div></span> through drawing, painting, animating pictures, and composing and generating music. »

« Another interesting nugget was that children really needed as much or more computing power than adults were willing to settle for when using a timesharing system. The best that timesharing has to offer is slow control of crude wire-frame green-tinted graphics and square-wave musical tones. »

« Any character font can be described as a <span
class="popup-trigger-matrix"><mark>matrix</mark>  <div class="popup-matrix"><p class="texto-4">the set of conditions that provides a system in which something grows or develops.</p></div></span> of black and white dots. The owner can draw in a character font of his own choosing. He can then immediately view font changes within the context of text displayed in a window. »
